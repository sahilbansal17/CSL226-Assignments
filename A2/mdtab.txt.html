<h6>A Markdown translator for HTML text + HTML tables from csv format</h6>

<p></center></p>

<p>We need to do the following. Create a markdown+table <em>functional</em> program in SML
using the functionalities given in <tt>fileIO.sml</tt>.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>This HTML file <tt>mdtab.txt.html</tt> was produced by running
<a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax">markdown</a> on the text file <tt>mdtab.txt</tt>.
Use the text file to test your own program.</p></li>
<li><p>To know about markdown go to the <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax">markdown syntax</a>
page maintained by John Gruber. Many of the simplifications listed
below also refer to Gruber's document. </p></li>
<li><p>Recognize and leave all inline HTML tags unchanged.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Headings.</strong> Do not implement the underlining feature of 
markdown. Implement only the headings defined by hashes. 
Hence you must implement the 6 levels of headings which 
are the levels shown in
the centered lines at the beginning of this document. The
number of hashes at the beginning of the line indicates the 
heading level.</p></li>
<li><p>Implement the following for pure text elements -- 
Use of double asterisks for <strong>bolding</strong> and single asterisks for
<em>italics</em>.
There is nothing in markdown for underlining -- under-scores are
used for italics and bolding as an alternative to
asterisks. Instead implement underlining as follows.
Example: "_underlined_text_" produces <u>underlined text</u>).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Horizontal Ruling</strong>. Implement only the code corresponding to
the use of at least 3 consecutive hypens (---) to produce
a horizontal line.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Block quotes.</strong> Implement only the email-style block-quoting
(i.e. every line in a block quote should begin with >, 
otherwise it is not a block quote) along with the nested
block-quoting.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Links.</strong> Implement the direct href produced by the
using the "[text](http://url/of/the/link)" syntax. Also implement the
automatic links feature e.g.</p>

<pre><code> &lt;http://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/~sak&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>renders as <a href="http://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/~sak">http://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/~sak</a> which
provides the URL and the link to the URL.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Lists.</strong> Implement </p>

<ul>
<li><em>ordered lists</em> -- as given by <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax">John Gruber</a>. Pay particular 
attention to his 1986 example relating to escape sequencing the
"." in case 1986 comes at the beginning of a line.</li>
<li><em>unordered lists</em> -- implement only the hyphen (as done here).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Implement tables from csv format. For example the following is</p>

<pre><code> &lt;&lt;
 1|2|3|4|9
 5|6|7|8|10
 11|12|13|14|15
 &gt;&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>a possible syntax for an HTML table that looks like</p></li>
</ol>

<p><CENTER><TABLE border="1">
  <TR><TD>1</TD><TD>2</TD><TD>3</TD><TD>4</TD><TD>9</TD></TR>
  <TR><TD>5</TD><TD>6</TD><TD>7</TD><TD>8</TD><TD>10</TD></TR>
  <TR><TD>11</TD><TD>12</TD><TD>13</TD><TD>14</TD><TD>15</TD></TR>
</TABLE></CENTER></p>

<ol>
<li>Since this is as clear as possible and has already been discussed
in class, I will entertain no individual doubts on any forum. If you
still have some doubts, <font color=red>make reasonable design
decisions and explicitly state them as comments at the top of your
submission file.</li>
</ol>
